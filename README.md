# logo-detection-project
Automatic Detection of Brand Logos is a tool identifying brand logos in images and
videos, and calculate how long the logo is visible. It can not only identify 10 different
brands, 5 international brands and 5 Chinese brands, (Adidas, Kappa, New
Balance, Nike, Puma, 361, Anta, Erke, Lining, Xtep) but also locate the logo that
has not been seen before, the logo that has not been trained. Given the specific
logo image, the system can mark the location of the logo in the pictures and videos.
It can help evaluate marketing campaigns, capture user reviews of the product,
counterfeit detection and protect brands' intellectual property, personalize product
recommendations, improve search algorithms.
